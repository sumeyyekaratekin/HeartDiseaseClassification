# Heart Disease Classification

This dataset is from the "Heart Disease UCI" competition on Kaggle and contains information related to heart disease diagnosis.
It includes various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, 
and several medical measurements to help predict the presence of heart disease in patients. 
The dataset has been used for classification tasks in machine learning to predict heart disease outcomes.

## Dataset Description

This dataset consists of 14 columns, each representing a different feature of the patients:

1. **age**: The age of the patient.
2. **sex**: The gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
3. **cp**: Type of chest pain (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic).
4. **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure in mmHg.
5. **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
6. **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar (1 = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, 0 = otherwise).
7. **restecg**: Resting Electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy).
8. **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
9. **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
10. **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. **slope**: Peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping).
12. **ca**: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13. **thal**: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect).
14. **num**: Diagnosis of heart disease (0 = absence, 1, 2, 3, 4 = presence).
